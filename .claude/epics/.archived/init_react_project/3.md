# Task: Development Tools Setup

## Description
Configure development tools including Biome for linting and formatting, and Husky for git hooks to ensure code quality and consistency throughout the development process.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Biome linting rules active with proper React v19 support
- [ ] Husky installed as devDependency with pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Git hooks run Biome checks before commits via pnpm scripts
- [ ] pnpm scripts configured for linting and formatting

## Technical Details
- Install @biomejs/biome as devDependency using `pnpm add -D @biomejs/biome`
- Configure biome.json with React and TypeScript rules
- Install husky as devDependency using `pnpm add -D husky`
- Set up pre-commit hook to run `pnpm run biome:check`
- Add pnpm scripts in package.json:
  - `"biome:check": "biome check --apply"`
  - `"lint": "biome lint"`
  - `"format": "biome format --write"`
- Key files: biome.json, .husky/pre-commit, package.json scripts

## Dependencies
