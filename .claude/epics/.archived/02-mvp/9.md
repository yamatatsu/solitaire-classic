# Task: Game feature structure and TDD setup

## Description
Setup Test-Driven Development environment and create comprehensive game feature structure within the features/game/ module. Establish testing framework configuration specifically for the game feature module to enable TDD for all subsequent game logic implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test framework configured for features/game/ module with proper Jest/Vitest setup
- [ ] Basic test structure in place with sample tests for game feature components
- [ ] Game feature module properly organized with clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Test utilities and helpers created for game-specific testing scenarios
- [ ] Mock data and test fixtures available for card and game state testing
- [ ] CI/CD integration works with the new test structure
- [ ] Test coverage reporting configured for the game feature

## Technical Details
- Configure testing framework (likely Vitest based on Vite setup) for game feature module
- Create test setup files and utilities specific to game logic testing
- Establish testing patterns for Jotai atoms and React components within the game feature
- Set up proper test organization mirroring the src/features/game/ structure
- Configure test coverage thresholds specifically for game module
- Create helper functions for testing card interactions and game state changes
- Ensure tests can run in isolation and don't interfere with each other

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Setup shadcn UI and bulletproof-react project structure) must be completed
- [ ] Existing test infrastructure from Vite project

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Test framework configured and working
- [ ] Sample tests written and passing
- [ ] Test utilities and helpers created
- [ ] Documentation updated with testing guidelines for game feature
