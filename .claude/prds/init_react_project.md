# PRD: init_react_project

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the requirements for initializing a minimal hello-world React application. The project will be built using modern web technologies including Vite, TypeScript, and React, designed to run as a single-page application on GitHub Pages. The application will serve as a foundation and starting point for future development, demonstrating basic React functionality with a clean, professional setup.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Many React projects start with complex boilerplate or unnecessary dependencies that slow down initial development. Developers need a clean, minimal starting point that demonstrates modern React development practices with proper tooling setup.

### Why is this important now?
- Modern React development requires proper tooling configuration
- GitHub Pages provides free, reliable hosting for static sites
- TypeScript adoption is increasing for better development experience
- Clean project initialization saves time and reduces technical debt

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**Developer**
- Wants to start a new React project quickly
- Values modern tooling and best practices
- Needs a clean foundation to build upon

**Project Stakeholder**
- Wants to see the project setup and initial deployment
- Values quick feedback and visible progress
- Needs confidence in the technical foundation

### Detailed User Journeys

**Developer Experience**
1. Developer clones or views the project repository
2. Application loads quickly with clear "Hello World" message
3. Code structure is clean and well-organized
4. Development server starts quickly and hot-reloads work
5. Build process produces optimized output

**Stakeholder Experience**
1. Stakeholder visits the deployed application URL
2. Application loads quickly showing professional hello-world page
3. Can verify the technical foundation is solid
4. Sees evidence of proper tooling and setup

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- Complex project initialization
- Slow development server startup
- Poor build tool configuration
- Missing TypeScript setup
- Lack of professional presentation

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Features and Capabilities

**Application Structure**
- Clean React component hierarchy
- Proper TypeScript type definitions
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript syntax
- Component-based architecture

**User Interface**
- Professional hello-world landing page
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Clean, modern styling with Tailwind CSS
- Proper semantic HTML structure

**Development Experience**
- Fast development server with hot-reload
- TypeScript error checking
- Code formatting with Biome
- Git hooks for quality checks

**Build and Deployment**
- Optimized production builds
- Static asset optimization
- GitHub Pages deployment
- Automated CI/CD pipeline

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance Expectations
- Initial load time under 2 seconds
- Lighthouse Performance Score > 95
- Time to Interactive < 1s
- Minimal bundle size
- Works on all modern browsers

#### Security Considerations
- No server-side dependencies
- No user data collection
- No external API calls
- Secure static site hosting

#### Scalability Needs
- Static site architecture for easy deployment
- CDN-friendly asset structure
- Modular code architecture for future additions
- Efficient bundling configuration

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
- Application loads and displays within 2 seconds
- Zero runtime errors in production
- TypeScript compilation with zero errors
- Works on all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design works on screens from 320px to 4K

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Time to interactive < 1 second
- Lighthouse performance score > 95
- Zero accessibility violations (WCAG AA)
- Bundle size < 100KB gzipped

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Limitations
- Must work as a static site (no backend server)
- GitHub Pages hosting limitations (no server-side processing)
- Browser localStorage limits for game state
- Must work without any external API dependencies

### Timeline Constraints
- Project setup and initialization phase only (this PRD)
- Future features will be handled in separate iterations

### Resource Limitations
- Single developer hobby project
- No budget for paid services or assets
- Limited time for development (hobby project)

### Assumptions
- Users have modern browsers (ES6+ support)
- Users have JavaScript enabled
- Basic familiarity with solitaire rules
- Internet connection only needed for initial load

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT building in this phase:**
- Complex UI components or layouts
- User authentication or accounts
- Database or backend services
- Advanced state management (Redux, Zustand)
- Routing or navigation
- Form handling or validation
- API integrations
- Complex animations or transitions
- Mobile app versions
- Advanced testing beyond basic setup
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Complex build optimizations

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

**Development Tools**
- Node.js and pnpm for package management
- Git for version control
- GitHub for repository hosting
- GitHub Pages for deployment

**Core Technologies**
- Vite - Build tool and dev server
- React v19 - Latest UI framework with new features
- TypeScript - Type safety and better DX
- Jotai - State management (for future use)
- TanStack Router - Routing (for potential future pages)

**UI and Styling**
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first styling
- shadcn/ui - Component library
- CSS for card animations

**Development Quality**
- Biome - Linting and formatting
- Vitest - Testing framework
- Husky - Git hooks
- GitHub Actions - CI/CD

### Internal Team Dependencies
- None (single developer project)

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Project Structure
```
src/
  ├── components/     # React components
  ├── styles/         # Global styles and Tailwind config
  ├── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
  └── utils/          # Helper functions (if needed)
```

### Build and Deployment
- Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- GitHub Actions for automated deployment to GitHub Pages
- Basic asset optimization

## Next Steps

After PRD approval:
1. Run `/pm:prd-parse init_react_project` to create implementation epic
2. Set up development environment
3. Initialize Vite project with TypeScript
4. Configure all development tools
5. Create hello-world React component
6. Apply basic styling
7. Set up deployment pipeline
8. Deploy to GitHub Pages
