# Task: Setup shadcn UI and bulletproof-react project structure

## Description
Install shadcn/ui component library, Jotai state management, and establish bulletproof-react project structure with feature-based organization. Create the features/game/ module structure that will house all solitaire game components, logic, and state management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] shadcn/ui properly configured with Tailwind CSS integration
- [ ] Jotai installed and configured for atomic state management
- [ ] Bulletproof-react folder structure created with src/app/, src/features/game/, src/components/, etc.
- [ ] features/game/ module has api/, components/, hooks/, stores/, types/, utils/ folders
- [ ] shadcn components can be imported and used (verify with a basic Button component)
- [ ] TypeScript configuration supports the new folder structure
- [ ] All imports resolve correctly without path issues

## Technical Details
- Follow bulletproof-react architecture principles with feature-based organization
- Use `npx shadcn@latest init` to set up shadcn/ui with proper configuration
- Install Jotai with `npm install jotai` for atomic state management
- Create feature-based structure under src/features/game/ for game-specific code
- Configure path aliases in vite.config.ts and tsconfig.json for clean imports
- Set up proper barrel exports (index.ts files) in each feature folder
- Ensure shadcn components work with existing Vite + React setup

## Dependencies
- [ ] Existing Vite + React + TypeScript project (already in place)
- [ ] No task dependencies (foundation task)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Folder structure created and organized
- [ ] Dependencies installed and configured
- [ ] Basic shadcn component renders successfully
- [ ] Documentation updated with new project structure
