# PRD: init_react_project

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the requirements for initializing a React-based Solitaire Classic browser game project. The project will be built using modern web technologies including Vite, TypeScript, and React, designed to run as a single-page application on GitHub Pages. The game will provide a classic solitaire card game experience with smooth animations, responsive design, and an intuitive user interface.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Many existing online solitaire games are cluttered with ads, require internet connectivity for basic functionality, or lack a clean, modern interface. Users want a simple, fast-loading, ad-free solitaire game that works offline once loaded and provides a pleasant gaming experience.

### Why is this important now?
- Browser-based games have become increasingly popular for casual gaming
- GitHub Pages provides free, reliable hosting for static sites
- Modern web technologies enable smooth, native-like gaming experiences in browsers
- There's a demand for clean, distraction-free implementations of classic games

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**Casual Gamer**
- Wants to play solitaire during breaks or downtime
- Values quick loading times and no setup required
- Prefers clean, intuitive interfaces without distractions

**Solitaire Enthusiast**
- Plays regularly and wants a reliable, bug-free experience
- Appreciates game statistics and tracking
- Values smooth animations and responsive controls

### Detailed User Journeys

**First-Time Player**
1. User discovers game link (GitHub Pages URL)
2. Game loads quickly in their browser
3. Instructions are clear or game is intuitive enough to start immediately
4. User can start playing within seconds
5. Game state persists if they need to leave and return

**Returning Player**
1. User bookmarks or remembers the game URL
2. Game loads with their previous statistics intact
3. Can immediately start a new game or resume if one was in progress
4. Settings and preferences are remembered

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- Slow-loading games with heavy assets
- Intrusive advertisements disrupting gameplay
- Poor mobile responsiveness
- Lost game progress on refresh
- Confusing or cluttered interfaces

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Features and Capabilities

**Game Initialization**
- Set up standard 52-card deck
- Implement classic Solitaire (Klondike) rules
- Deal cards in proper formation (7 tableau piles, stock pile)
- Initialize empty foundation piles (4 suits)

**Game Mechanics**
- Drag and drop card movement
- Click to auto-move cards to foundations
- Draw cards from stock (1 or 3 card draw options)
- Validate legal moves according to solitaire rules
- Auto-complete when possible
- Undo/Redo functionality

**User Interface**
- Responsive card layout that adapts to screen size
- Visual feedback for valid/invalid moves
- Card animations for dealing, moving, and flipping
- Score display and move counter
- Timer for game duration
- New game button
- Settings menu

**Game State Management**
- Save game state to localStorage
- Resume interrupted games
- Track statistics (games won, best time, win streak)
- Reset statistics option

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance Expectations
- Initial load time under 3 seconds on 3G connection
- Smooth animations at 60 FPS
- Instant response to user interactions (<100ms)
- Minimal memory footprint
- Works on devices with limited resources

#### Security Considerations
- No server-side dependencies for core gameplay
- All data stored locally in browser
- No user authentication required
- No sensitive data collection

#### Scalability Needs
- Static site architecture for easy deployment
- CDN-friendly asset structure
- Modular code architecture for feature additions
- Efficient bundling and code splitting

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
- Game loads and is playable within 3 seconds
- Zero runtime errors in production
- 100% of standard solitaire moves are correctly implemented
- Game works on all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design works on screens from 320px to 4K

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- Time to interactive < 2 seconds
- Lighthouse performance score > 90
- Zero accessibility violations (WCAG AA)
- 100% offline functionality after initial load

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Limitations
- Must work as a static site (no backend server)
- GitHub Pages hosting limitations (no server-side processing)
- Browser localStorage limits for game state
- Must work without any external API dependencies

### Timeline Constraints
- Project setup and initialization phase only (this PRD)
- Future features will be handled in separate iterations

### Resource Limitations
- Single developer hobby project
- No budget for paid services or assets
- Limited time for development (hobby project)

### Assumptions
- Users have modern browsers (ES6+ support)
- Users have JavaScript enabled
- Basic familiarity with solitaire rules
- Internet connection only needed for initial load

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT building in this phase:**
- Multiple solitaire variants (Spider, FreeCell, etc.)
- Multiplayer or competitive features
- User accounts or cloud save
- Social features (sharing, leaderboards)
- Monetization features
- Mobile app versions
- Backend services
- Advanced animations or 3D graphics
- Sound effects and music (initial version)
- Customizable card backs and themes (initial version)
- Hints system
- Tutorial mode

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

**Development Tools**
- Node.js and pnpm for package management
- Git for version control
- GitHub for repository hosting
- GitHub Pages for deployment

**Core Technologies**
- Vite - Build tool and dev server
- React 18+ - UI framework
- TypeScript - Type safety and better DX
- Jotai - State management
- TanStack Router - Routing (for potential future pages)

**UI and Styling**
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first styling
- shadcn/ui - Component library
- CSS for card animations

**Development Quality**
- Biome - Linting and formatting
- Vitest - Testing framework
- Husky - Git hooks
- GitHub Actions - CI/CD

### Internal Team Dependencies
- None (single developer project)

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Project Structure
```
