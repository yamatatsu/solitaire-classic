### Completed Tasks ✅

1. **Biome Installation**: Installed @biomejs/biome 2.2.4 as devDependency
2. **Husky Installation**: Installed husky 9.1.7 as devDependency  
3. **Biome Configuration**: Created biome.json with React and TypeScript rules
4. **Package.json Scripts**: Added required pnpm scripts:
   - `biome:check`: "biome check --write"
   - `lint`: "biome lint" 
   - `format`: "biome format --write"
5. **ESLint Removal**: Replaced ESLint with Biome in lint script
6. **Husky Setup**: Configured pre-commit hook to run `pnpm run biome:check`
7. **Testing**: Verified all commands work correctly

### Configuration Files

- **.husky/pre-commit**: Set up to run Biome checks before commits
- **package.json**: Updated with Biome scripts and Husky prepare script

### Test Results

- ✅ `pnpm run lint`: Successfully detects code issues
- ✅ `pnpm run format`: Formats code correctly

### Acceptance Criteria Status

- ✅ Biome installed as devDependency in package.json
- ✅ Biome linting rules active with proper React v19 support
- ✅ Husky installed as devDependency with pre-commit hooks
- ✅ Git hooks run Biome checks before commits via pnpm scripts
- ✅ pnpm scripts configured for linting and formatting

### Next Steps
